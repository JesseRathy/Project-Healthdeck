HealthDeck will be your companion app for you to know your healthcare practitioners better!

  - Just scan your practitioner's QR code from their ID
  - You'll be able to add their card to your healthcare deck
  - Magic

# Features!

  - Users will be able to edit their practitioner card lineup
  - A nifty carousel that shows all the cards you have scanned into your roster

### Tech

HealthDeck uses the following technologies and open source projects to work properly:

* [Jest] and [Enzyme] - for testing 
* [MongoDB] - for database access
* [React Native] - duh

# Installation

### Development environment prerequisites

HealthDeck requires these tools for development:

- Node > 7 and npm (Recommended: Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
- Watchman `brew install watchman`
- React Native CLI `npm install -g react-native-cli`
- XCode > 9
- [JDK > 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

### Testing environment

Our project is powered by TDD, using Jest and Enzyme. Our code for testing is still under development, but we'll update this space with instructions on how to do testing when we're done.

### Todos

 - Write LOTS of Tests
 - Tell Molhan about the ESLit style guide
 - Create migrations and seeders for the database
 - Prepare Incremental Deliverable 1
 - Party hard
 - Integrate Travis to check the build integrity

### The Dev Team

We're a pretty cool bunch. We like coding, coffee, and party parrots. We are Group 1 - we don't have a group name yet, but who needs a group name when we're literally Group Numero Uno?!
